Resource Leak Exposure;None;None;Software;If possible leverage coding language(s) that do not allow this weakness to occur (e.g. Java and Ruby and Python all perform automatic garbage collection that releases memory for objects that have been deallocated)., Memory should always be allocated/freed using matching functions (e.g. malloc/free or new/delete and etc.), Implement best practices with respect to memory management including the freeing of all allocated resources at all exit points and ensuring consistency with how and where memory is freed in a function.;Improper Resource Shutdown or Release

Sustained Client Engagement;HTTP DoS;None;Software;Potential mitigations include requiring a unique login for each resource request constraining local unprivileged access by disallowing simultaneous engagements of the resource or limiting access to the resource to one access per IP address.

Brute Force;Encryption Brute Forcing, Password Brute Forcing;None;Software;Select a provably large secret space for selection of the secret. Provably large means that the procedure by which the secret is selected does not have artifacts that significantly reduce the size of the total secret space., Use a secret space that is well known and with no known patterns that may reduce functional size., Do not provide the means for an attacker to determine success independently. This forces the attacker to check their guesses against an external authority which can slow the attack and warn the defender. This mitigation may not be possible if testing material must appear externally such as with a transmitted cryptotext.;Use of Insufficiently Random Values, Inadequate Encryption Strength, Weak Password Requirements
Buffer Manipulation;Overflow Buffers, Overread Buffers;None;Software;To help protect an application from buffer manipulation attacks, a number of potential mitigations can be leveraged. Before starting the development of the application, consider using a code language (e.g. Java) or compiler that limits the ability of developers to act beyond the bounds of a buffer. If the chosen language is susceptible to buffer related issues (e.g. C) then consider using secure functions instead of those vulnerable to buffer manipulations. If a potentially dangerous function must be used - make sure that proper boundary checking is performed. Additionally there are often a number of compiler-based mechanisms (e.g. StackGuard and ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag) that can help identify and protect against potential buffer issues. Finally - there may be operating system level preventative functionality that can be applied.;Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer

Using an allowlist for input is desired but if use of a denylist approach is necessary then focusing on command related terms and delimiters is necessary., Input should be encoded prior to use in commands to make sure command related characters are not treated as part of the command. For example quotation characters may need to be encoded so that the application does not treat the quotation as a delimiter., Input should be parameterized or restricted to data sections of a command thus removing the chance that the input will be treated as part of the command itself.;Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command (Command Injection)
